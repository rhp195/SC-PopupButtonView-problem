SC-PopupButtonView-Problem
==================

Created a small program to highligh a problem I'm having with PopupButtonViews in a SC.View.
There are 2 popupButtonViews, each with a menu associated with it.  Besides the ugly default style
(I assume), the first menu pops up at the buttons (0,0) point, covering the button, while the second pops up
just under the button as it should.  "screen_shot.jpg" shows problem. Any ideas?
